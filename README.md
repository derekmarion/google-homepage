This is a tutorial exercise designed to practice basic html/css skills.

The challenge is to copy the look and feel of the google homepage, without worrying about the more advanced features lying outside what's possible with html/csss.

After completing this exercise, I have a firmer grasp how to position fixed elements on a page, proper use of divs, classes, style inheritance, and versioning using git.
